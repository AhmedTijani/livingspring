    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>
      At Living Spring Home Care Services, our mission is to improve the health
      and quality of life of the seniors and adults with disabilities as we
      serve their needs with dignity, respect, responsiveness and compassion by
      providing professional home care services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner founded this agency by working as a private home care provider,
      as a care manager, Scheduler and recruiter for several agencies in which
      she established relationships with outside members of the home care field
      and care providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In doing so, she became such an asset to home care agencies that the
      demand for her services became overwhelming. As a result, she was then
      obligated to create a staff, form a business, and inherit a lifelong
      career in serving clients. Behind this much needed service, she developed
      a large reputation of providing the highest quality care within the
      community. she established valued relationships with clients, caregivers,
      and many other people within the community in which she serviced. We
      intend to continue that custom by hiring quality home care providers.
      Thank you for choosing Living Spring Services to Serve you!!

    <h2>OUR CAREGIVERS</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure that our clients are receiving the highest quality of care from
      our Home Care Agency, each of our home care providers has been trained
      specifically to provide compassionate assistance for your loved one, using
      industry best practices, health, and safety standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our home care providers are the heart and soul of our home care services,
      which is why we are very proud of each of them, ensuring your loved one
      receives the highest level of care possible. Before our caregivers are
      hired, they must each pass a detailed background check, and become
      licensed, bonded, and insured with our agency for your peace of mind. But
      before they are sent to your home, they must pass a training session and
      prove their capability to provide compassionate and professional care
      services.
