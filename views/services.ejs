        <h2>GENERAL CARE</h2>

        <br>
        <p>
          <strong>How We Provide Care:</strong><br>
          We begin by assessing your needs through discussions with you or an
          involved family member to ensure that the proper care and care plans
          are being developed and implemented. Next, working in conjunction with
          the family, we develop an individualized program to manage your daily
          needs. We match your needs to the best possible caregiver(s). After
          the <strong>Living Spring Services</strong> caregiver has been placed
          into your home, we continue our unique system of continued
          personalized contacts through telephone check-in and home visits by
          our care manager. Most important of all, we continually communicate
          with the caregivers who are providing care to you for updates or any
          changes in your condition.
