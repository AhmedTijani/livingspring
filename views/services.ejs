          <strong>How We Provide Care:</strong><br>
          We begin by assessing your needs through discussions with you or an
          involved family member to ensure that the proper care and care plans
          are being developed and implemented. Next, working in conjunction with
          the family, we develop an individualized program to manage your daily
          needs. We match your needs to the best possible caregiver(s). After
          the <strong>Living Spring Services</strong> caregiver has been placed
          into your home, we continue our unique system of continued
          personalized contacts through telephone check-in and home visits by
          our care manager. Most important of all, we continually communicate
          with the caregivers who are providing care to you for updates or any
          changes in your condition.

            It is common for seniors with mobility issues or cognitive limitations to have difficulty with basic self-care tasks, also known as activities of daily living (ADLs).

            Our caregivers can help you with the following ADLs:
            <br>

We will choose a caregiver who we feel will provide excellent care services and be a good fit as a companion for the client.
            <br>
            Our elderly care services start with a visit from our staff to evaluate the home and unique care needs of the client.  With input from you and your loved ones, we will form a care plan that accommodates their care needs and includes a schedule for our caregiver.  Our home care plans can always be adjusted if the care needs of your loved ones change.

          <h2>RESPITE CARE SERVICES</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Family caregivers put long hours into caring for their relatives which can take a toll on their personal lives and their health.  Our respite care services will allow your family caregivers to take some time off while our licensed caregivers provide care for you or your loved ones.
          <br>
            The responsibilities of being a family caregiver can be difficult to handle as family caregivers end up devoting much of their time to providing home care.  This makes it difficult to have a career or spend time with immediate family.  The long hours of being a family caregiver can also be stressful and cause the caregiver to lose sleep which can lead to physical health problems and other issues such as depression.
            <br>
            Our respite care services can benefit your family caregiver and you or your loved one receiving the care by allowing the family caregiver some time off to recharge and deal with personal matters.  While the family caregiver takes time off, you or your loved ones will be in the hands of our trained and licensed caregiver.
            <br>
            When you call us for respite care services, we will evaluate the care needs of you or your loved ones as well as the type of care that the family caregiver provides.  Living Spring Home Care Services will make sure that our caregiver provides the type of care that you or your loved one is used to from the family caregiver to make the transition as seamless as possible.
            <br>
            <strong>Our respite care services provide the following:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>

              <li>Quality care from our licensed caregivers</li>

          <br>
            Hospice care is the care that people receive when they have a limited life expectancy or a terminal illness.  The purpose of hospice care is to keep the care recipient as comfortable and pain free as possible and allow them to live their remaining days with dignity.
            <br>
            At Living Spring Home Care Services, our caregivers provide personal care and companionship for senior citizens to ensure that they get excellent care and meaningful companionship.  Our caregivers aim to provide more than just quality care for you or your loved ones.

            <br>
            Our caregivers can provide your loved ones with hospice care which will allow your family to manage other affairs and visit with your loved ones.  Our care manager will help develop a personalized care plan based on your loved one’s unique needs to help keep them comfortable and pain free.  
            <br>
            Our hospice care services start with an in-home assessment so that we can understand the specific care needs of your loved one.  We will then form a care plan that includes non-medical assistance to address their needs and ensure they are comfortable in their final days.

          <h2>FALL PREVENTION SERVICES</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            Per the CDC, most severe injuries and deaths for elderly adults older than 65 years old are caused by falls as a result of medications, illnesses, and environmental factors.
          <br>
            Their data also states that seniors are 75 percent more likely to suffer another fall within six months.
            <br>
            A neat, tidy, organized home environment, can greatly reduce the risk of falls while a crowded, messy living space, leads to a heightened risk. Less allergens can also relieve chronic allergies and respiratory issues, but cleaning can be a tough task for some seniors.
            <br>
            Our friendly, well-trained caregivers know the causes and risks of falling. We can help with the following:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul class="wwd-list">
              <li>Getting up and out of bed and from chairs</li>

          <br>
            Senior citizens often experience loneliness if their family lives a great distance away or if their friends are far away or have passed on.  It is common for seniors who are lonely to experience depression.

            Our caregivers will care for individuals after surgery and help them follow their doctor’s orders to ensure they fully recover from their surgery.
            <br>
            Numerous healthcare changes over the past few years have resulted in a lot of patients getting discharged from rehabilitation centers following surgery or an illness before they’re able to provide their own care. 
            <br>
            In such a case, families need to search for other options. Many patients don’t want to go to a nursing home or other post-operative care facility. Rather, they prefer the comfort and familiarity of their own home, but it’s unsafe for them to be there on their own.
            <br>
            At Living Spring Home Care Services, we offer post-surgical care services to help you or your loved ones recover at their home. Abiding to all doctors’ instructions and post-operative care procedures is crucial in order to ensure a complete recovery. Our caregivers are aware of this and will make sure your loved one follows the doctor’s instructions to make a full recovery.
            <br>
            We will develop a personalized home care plan for you or your loved one by speaking with their nurses, surgical coordinators, and/or doctors. Furthermore, our caregivers are all properly trained to help patients with the transition process. With our services, we strive to provide your loved one with a safe and seamless transition back home so they can fully recover.
